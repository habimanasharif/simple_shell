# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
This consists of interpreting orders. In this project we'll create a simple UNIX command interpreter in C programming language.

# Description
This is a command line interpreter, or shell, in the tradition of the first Unix shell written by Ken Thompson in 1971. This was made as a project for ALX Holberton School. In this project we apply the knowledge that we have learned in C programming language.
